# Duolingo German Tips and Notes

### Welcome to German :)

​             Welcome to the German course! We will provide you with tips and notes throughout the course. However, be             aware that these are optional. Only read them when you feel stuck, or when you are interested in the             details. You can use the course without them.         

​             Often, it's best to just **dive into the practice**. See how it goes! You can always revisit the             Notes section later on.         

### Capitalizing nouns

​             In German, **all nouns are capitalized**. For example, "my name" is *mein **N**ame*,             and "the apple" is *der **A**pfel*. This helps you identify which words are the nouns in             a sentence.
